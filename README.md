# Road Accident Dashboard ‚Äì Tableau Project

üìä Overview
This Tableau project presents a comprehensive and interactive visualization of road accidents that occurred across the UK. The analysis leverages a dataset comprising various features like accident severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight), number of casualties, weather conditions, light and road surface conditions, location data (latitude/longitude), and vehicle types involved.

The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders such as transportation authorities, safety analysts, urban planners, and policy-makers Identify risk-prone areas based on high accident density using geospatial mapping.
Assess how weather and road surface conditions influence accident frequency and severity, with special focus on slight casualties which are more frequent and often preventable.
Monitor trends across different months, helping to understand seasonal patterns that might affect road safety.
Break down the impact of different vehicle types, providing insights into which vehicles are more frequently involved in serious or fatal accidents.
Evaluate road infrastructure implications, such as which types of roads (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway) see more accidents under different environmental conditions.
By transforming raw data into an interactive visual tool, this project enables faster and more effective decision-making. Users can filter by accident severity, year, and other dimensions, making the dashboard highly versatile for exploration and storytelling.
This project also serves as a demonstration of my ability to:
Clean and preprocess raw government data
Design intuitive and informative BI dashboards
Draw actionable insights from large datasets

üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

‚úÖ 1. Total Accidents
Displays the total number of road accidents recorded for the selected time period.
Monthly trend analysis helps identify periods with spikes in accidents.
Year-over-year (YoY) comparison provides insight into whether road safety is improving or declining.

‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Fatal and Serious Casualties
Fatal and serious accidents are tracked separately to highlight high-impact incidents.
Monthly patterns show peaks in certain months, helping stakeholders focus on time-bound safety campaigns.
Drill-downs available by vehicle type, revealing which vehicles are more frequently involved in critical accidents.

üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 3. Slight Casualties
Slight injuries represent the majority of reported cases.
Breakdown by environmental and road conditions (e.g., weather, light, and surface type) offers insight into the external factors contributing to these incidents.
Helps identify which road types are more prone to minor accidents.

üåßÔ∏è 4. Weather Condition Analysis
Accidents are analyzed under different weather conditions like clear, rainy, foggy, and snowy.
Reveals how significantly poor weather increases accident probability.
Supports recommendations for infrastructure improvements (e.g., road signage, lighting).

üõ£Ô∏è 5. Road Surface and Road Type Impact
Assesses the influence of surface conditions such as dry, wet, or icy roads.
Comparison across road types like single carriageway, dual carriageway, roundabouts, and slip roads.
Helps prioritize road maintenance and improvements based on accident frequency.

üó∫Ô∏è 6. Geospatial Mapping
Visual map pinpoints accident locations across the country.
Heatmap helps identify high-risk zones and accident hotspots.
Supports location-specific interventions and law enforcement planning.

üóìÔ∏è 7. Time-Based Filters
Year and month filters allow comparative studies and seasonal trend identification.
Enables easy tracking of accident rates over time to monitor the impact of road safety measures.

üö¶ 8. Vehicle Type Involvement
Accidents segmented by vehicle type (e.g., car, bus, motorcycle, taxi, heavy goods vehicle).
Offers insights into which modes of transport are most affected or involved in serious incidents.
Supports policy-making and vehicle-specific safety regulation.


üéØ Business Requirements
The dashboard answers the following key questions:
What is the monthly and yearly trend of total, fatal, serious, and slight accidents?
Which vehicle types are most frequently involved in serious accidents?
How do weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, snow) influence accident frequency and severity?
What is the impact of road surface types and road types on accident outcomes?
Which geographic locations experience the most frequent road accidents?
How can this data support road safety policies and infrastructure improvements?

üß© Key Insights
Most serious casualties occurred in car-related accidents, followed by motorcycles and vans.
Slight casualties were more frequent during fine and dry conditions, which could indicate behavioral overconfidence in safe conditions.
Wet roads and poor visibility increase the likelihood of slight injuries.
Single carriageways reported the most accidents, followed by dual carriageways and roundabouts.
Accident hotspots were concentrated in urban locations, particularly in high-density regions.
There was no significant YoY improvement, indicating a need for deeper interventions.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This Tableau dashboard provides a visual framework to monitor and analyze road safety patterns across the UK. It can support:
Public safety campaigns and awareness efforts
Infrastructure upgrades in high-risk zones
Seasonal road safety planning
Data-backed policymaking
